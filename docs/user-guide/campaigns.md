# Email Campaigns

## Creating a Campaign
1. Go to **Campaigns** > **New Campaign**.
2. **Subject Line**: Make it catchy.
3. **Audience**: Select a segment (e.g., "All Contacts" or "High Engagement").
4. **Design**: Use the rich text editor to compose your message.

## Sending
- **Test Send**: Always send a test email to yourself first.
- **Broadcast**: Click "Send Now" to blast to the list.
*Performance: The system sends in batches of 50 to avoid rate limits.*

## Analytics
After sending, view the report to see:
- **Open Rate**: Percentage of users who opened.
- **Click Rate**: Percentage who clicked a link.
