# Check-in System

The Check-in system is designed for mobile devices (laptops/tablets) at the event entrance.

## Accessing the Scanner
Navigate to `/checkin`.
*Note: You must be logged in as an Admin.*

## How to Scan
1. Allow camera permissions when prompted.
2. Point the camera at the attendee's QR code.
3. The system will beep and show a green "Success" banner.

### Manual Check-in
If a user forgot their QR code:
1. Go to the Admin Dashboard > Contacts.
2. Search for the user.
3. Manually toggle their "Attended" status (if feature enabled) or use the Search bar in the Check-in interface.
